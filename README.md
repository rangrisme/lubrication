# README #
This Simple.h, Simple.cpp are LAMMPS scripts for the simplified lubrication force. The theory (or rather the algebra) behind the simplification is given in the pdf file.

### What is this repository for? ###

* Calculating lubrication force between two particles using [LAMMPS](https://github.com/lammps).
* Calculating Stokes drag for every particle using LAMMPS.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Copy Simple.h and Simple.cpp in LAMMPS installation's src folder and recreate the LAMMPS executable.
* It depends on pair_lubricate.h that is included with LAMMPS.
* All the flags are the same as [lubricate/poly](http://lammps.sandia.gov/doc/pair_lubricate.html). flagfld now stands for Stokes drag. flagVF is left for legacy reasons and will not affect the results when set to 0 or 1.
* Ensure that the inner and outer cutoffs are greater than sphere diameter, and use pair_modify mix arithmetic for spheres of different sizes. (See collision.lmp example)
* Modify the two particle collison code: collision.lmp, and compare it using the matlab scripts provided.

### Contribution guidelines ###

* Please email Ranga for updates or features needed. You are welcome to modify and use this code to your specs.

### Who do I talk to? ###

* Ranga (r.radhakrishnan@ed.ac.uk)


### List of things to work on for future updates ###

1. Make the class to be independent of pair_lubricate files.
2. Make the cutoffs with arithmetic mean by default.
3. When Stokes drag is included using flagfld=1, change v_stream velocities based on the bottom edge of the box. Currently v_stream assumes the box bottom edges to be at 0, it needs to depend on the actual box dimensions. Note that the v_stream in both the cases will only differ by a constant, and will not have much impact on the steady state results.
